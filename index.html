<h2>Hulu Ad Mute</h2>

<h3>The Basic Idea</h3>
<p>
I pay for Hulu's streaming service. It has a decent amount of content and some I really
enjoy watching. Even though I pay for it, they display advertisements. While not ideal, 
I understand they have to make money somehow. In fact I'm no too interested as it doesn't
impact our budget very much. 
</p>

<p>
    What is intrusive is the volume of the advertisements relative to the content you're
    watching. Streaming services aren't regulated like television commercials where there
    is a maximum volume that can be issued by the commercial. This means (from emperical
    observation) that many advertisers turn up the volumne on their commercials and make
    it unbearably loud. This is where this project comes in.
</p>

<p>
    Using Technology<sup>TM</sup> we can mute these ads using some basic optical 
    character recgonition (OCR). Each Hulu advertisement places a very clear circle
    with a counter in it, and more interestingly the word "Advertisement" next to it
    in the upper left corner of the display screen. By using a ZedBoard, an HDMI
    splitter, some software, an infared receiver and an infared transmitter we can make 
    a system that looks for this and mutes the television when detected. It should also 
    unmute the system when its no longer detected.
