  <h3>Bill Gates is awesome</h3>
  <div class="subhead">2020-05-06</div>

  <p>
    Don't believe me? Well, that's good because you should always do your own independent research to develop your own opinons. Much like the intent of this article, I attempted to do some of my own into Bill Gates when I came across the allegation that he was trying to control the population through vaccines. That's right, he's personally injecting deadly, poisonous cocktails directly into babies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bill and Melinda Gates, along with Warren Buffet started the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to funnel money into areas it determines would have the greatest impact in solving the worlds current problems. One of these areas deals with climate change and  CO2 emissions. Gates did a TED talk in 2010 explaining the logic for how the foundation invests its money. One of the things Gates mentioned is how controlling population growth plays an important role in not just reducing CO2 emissions but also helps alleviate a number of problems. From a Forbes article from 2011, Gates claims that across the board problems with jobs, unrest, and education become harder when there is a high population density.
  </p>

  <p>
    The premise of these ill conceived allegations are based on the concept that vaccines take more lives than they save and Gates promotes the use of this to subtly decrease the population. Not only do we know vaccines save lives, but Gate's true purpose was to save more children to help control the population growth. Note that he always refer to the rate of population rather than the exact population itself. I find this to be an interesting representation of those thinking about the larger picture with good information versus the ill informed conspiracies focused on a small portion of the problem out of context. Not to mention they are just simply wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may seem counter-intuitive that saving more children will help reduce population. Malthusisum is the belief that once people run into the catastrophe of having too many mouths for too little resources, the population will naturally curve itself. What Gates and his foundation has found is the opposite is actually true. It is also part of the reason he promotes vaccination. When there is a poor survival rate, families tend to have more children to offset this. Parents are hedging their bets so they have someone to care for them when they grow older.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gates pushes vaccines here for two reasons. First, vaccines are a tangible solution to a real problem. Babies can contract diseases and the world has invented a way to prevent that. The solution only requires the money to produce and deliver the solution, something the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has poised itself to solve. The second reason is as the mortality rate of babies goes down, the desire to have more children also goes down. Families stop having so many babies when there is less risk of loosing the children you do have.
  </p>

  <p>
    This solution can cascade into the problem areas previously mentioned, helping create a better lives for everyone in multiple ways. This demonstrates a very good return on investment when trying to figure out how lots of money can help solve world-class problems. The BAMGF is also impressive in how it has set up an investment trust to continuously generate money for these problems instead of just expecting one-time donations. Bloomberg also claims Gates would be the richest man in the world had he not donated so much of his wealth. He also still wears sneakers while waiting in line to buy a burger.

  <h3>Why is space black?</h3>
  <div class="subhead">2020-04-21</div>

  <p>
    It dawned on me once that this doesn't make intuitive sense. If we have a sun and there are many suns, potentially an uncountable amount, and there is nothing diminishing light from those suns to Earth, why is space so dark? This is not a new question, but this (probably short) article is mostly to keep a record of what I could find as an answer in my own words.
  </p>

  <p>
    Olbers' paradox is a description of this very observation. Being a paradox, it afforded me the comfort that I am not alone in not knowing everything. The initial assumptions and question are the same as my own, that the night sky would indeed be filled with the light from the all of the stars. The caveat is this would be true if the universe was static, meaning stars and planets were not in constant motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before talking about why the motion of the universe is important, we need to understand the properties of light and its transmission. Visible light is an electromagnetic wave transmitting within a specific frequency range. Within this specific range, the frequency can determine what color the light is.
  </p>

  <p>
    The graphic below shows the electromagnetic spectrum wavelengths between 380 nm and 750 nm (790 THz and 405 THz respectively). Light waves with frequencies outside this range are not visible, thus appear black.
  </p>

  <img src="Linear_visible_spectrum.svg" alt="Graphic by Wikipedia user Gringer" width=100%/>
  <div class="subhead">Graphic by Wikipedia user Gringer</div>

  <p>
    Stars produce light within the visible spectrum, like our sun. Back to Olber's paradox, using our understanding of the universe, stars and planets are in constant motion, which also means the distance between stars and planets are changing. This does not include all stars as some may be moving in parallel or be changing in distance very slowly.
  </p>

  <p>
    This constant change in distance causes the light produced from stars to change in frequency relative to planets that would observe that light (e.g. Earth), similar to doppler where sound waves change as an ambulance goes by you on the street. This phenomenon is known as redshift. The term "redshift" refers to the longest wavelengths of visible light being red, and as light wavelengths get longer, they "shift" towards red. The opposite is known as "blueshift".
  </p>

  <p>
    Knowing these things, we can see how many of the stars moving relative to Earth, produce light that will be shifted outside of the visible light frequency range. This still allows for the stars we can see, whose relative distances' aren't changing fast enough to shift the electromagnetic waves outside the visible spectrum.
  </p>

  <p>
    This particular observation is actually used to support the Big Band theory. For me it also reminds me that I still don't know everything and probably never will. But that's alright because figuring things out is what its all about (re-read in sing-song voice).
  </p>

  <h3>Exceptions</h3>
  <div class="subhead">2020-04-14</div>

  <p>
    Exceptions can be a very useful mechanism for writing less code while providing context for what went wrong. There are probably tall epics written describing how exceptions <i>should</i> be used, whether they should be used for flow control or not for example. I won't pretend to be a well-versed C++ philosopher, but I will describe one way that I think is effective, efficient and simple. It doesn't need to be complicated. Below is a typical use case for a C++ class wrapping a POSIX interface.
  </p>

  <pre>
void* FileReader::Read(const int fd, const int buffer_size) {
    uint8_t* buffer = new uint8_t[buffer_size];
    ssize_t rc = read(fd, buffer, buffer_size);
    if (rc != 0) {
        // Handle error
    }
    return buffer;
}</pre>

  <p>
    There are many ways to skin this cat. You could log an error and return nullptr. This would mean users of this function need to check the result returned for nullptr and handle it appropriately. In this context, this would defeat the purpose of the function. Half the function is handling the error. This is similar to returning an error code, without the context of what went wrong. Hopefully that is solved by logging in the function.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your on a system that can run Linux, likely you can handle throwing exceptions. Exceptions were invented to solve the problem described above. Regardless of the interface, errors are handled completely independent of normal program operation. I believe this is a better interface to use over returning error codes or reserving special values (e.g. nullptr for pointers) to indicate an error occurred.
  </p>

  <p>
    Assuming we've chosen to go with throwing errors versus returning error codes, we have to choose what type to throw. The C++20 standard defines almost 30 exception types to choose from. I believe it is usually better to use your own exception types rather than using exception types defined in the standard library. This will aide in reducing confusion for users or maintainers by differentiating the origin points of the error.
  </p>

  <p>
    As programmers, it is natural to wrap a layer of abstraction around specific code and concepts for the sake of reusability. Here, when I suggest using your own exception types, it seems natural to set up an entire slew of exception types, each defining a specific type of error that occurs so each one can be handled properly. I can sense the readers who have stopped reading and have already whipped out their editors to start writing a beautifully reusable system of exception definitions (see Poco's <tt><a href="https://github.com/pocoproject/poco/blob/master/Foundation/include/Poco/Exception.h#L157">POCO_DECLARE_EXCEPTION</a></tt>).
  </p>

  <p>
    I suggest doing this on a much smaller scale. Define one exception for your namespace, inherit from <tt>std::exception</tt>, and use this everywhere. Only define a custom exception when you actually need to handle resource clean up. When throwing, dynamic resources are not freed, but I would argue if you are throwing due to an exceptional circumstances let it get caught in main and exit in the default case. I've found this to be the 80% solution. Typical resources like memory and file handles will be released upon exit.
  </p>

  <p>
    And that's it. There are reasons you would want custom exceptions, to communicate specific information to the user of your code that something wrong and there is something they can do about it during runtime. They can catch these specific errors and programmatically deal with the errors. In my experience this situation happens <i>much less</i> often than just knowing what went wrong by logging a string and terminating the program.

  <h3>Adventures in SPI</h3>
  <div class="subhead">2019-12-19</div>
  <p>
    Serial peripheral interface (SPI) is a wonderful protocol. It has a simple way to serially transfer data in and out of multiple devices using one or more chip select lines, master-out/slave-in (MOSI) and master-in/slave-out (MISO) lines. You can use chip select lines for sending data in and out of various devices. The problem lies when your clock line doesn't clock. It's an even bigger problem when none of your voltages change when they are supposed to.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first step to realize everything is broken is first to get it working on a different system. Our system had a microcontroller, a couple of chips that spoke SPI and a uFPGA. The SPI lines were intended for the two chips, they were not going to be used for the uFPGA unless needed for an unforeseen reason. At the point in our development we wanted to talk to one of the chips, so we bought an evaluation board for the microcontroller and the chip we were currently targeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    With said evaluation boards, power supplies, cables, bread board, logic analyzer, and related software installed a suitable system was put together to develop the necessary software to configure the chip. Data sheets were poured over, software was developed and things were found to be working... on the development set up.
  </p>

  <p>
    After this, the software was loaded onto a custom hardware platform for testing. We we're very hopeful and instantly failed. The logic analyzer showed a vast wasteland of fixed voltages. After many rabbit holes were thoroughly explored, we settled on validating the lines were physically connected and could be driven correctly. This felt like a bad place to be in. To do this, we first targeted the SCLK line. We loaded the microcontroller with an image that put the SCLK into GPIO mode and started manually clocking. What we found was an attempt at clocking, but the voltages were not reaching their expected limits of 0 volts and 3.3 volts. Instead it was clocking between 0 and ~1.5 volts.
  </p>

  <p>
    This led us to believe another device was attempting to drive the line. A uFPGA that was using the SPI line, had some debug values set for those particular pins for the eval board and needed to be marked input. With this dealt with, manual clocking of the SPI clock was working wonderfully, driving the lines to the 3.3 and 0 volts limits. With our problem solved, we removed the custom MCU software and replaced it with the current production software. Once we applied the appropriate patch to the uFPGA software and loaded the working development code, we very let down to find that none of the SPI lines even toggled. The hunt for functionality continued.
  </p>

  <p>
    When initializing the SPI driver it correctly held SCLK high as required for our system but when data was written to the data output register, SCLK did not move. In fact no lines transitioned at all. This led to more rabbit holes to investigate for why these lines did not move. To make a longer story somewhat shorter, we found a multi-master SPI select pin on the microcontroller tied to ground instead of 3.3 volts. Multi-master is a great thing, but not when you don't correctly account for it. Having it wired this way caused all SPI operations to cease regardless of any software we could load, since the built in SPI peripheral was operating in a slave mode. A minor hardware change was required, but once in place, we filled in our rabbit holes and finally had SPI working.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main take away for me from this problem is to carefully approach the software design of custom hardware by first understanding each pin on the chip and how it fits into the overall design. This seems like a simple thing, but can be forgotten in the fray of functional requirements and deadlines. Better developers than I have started their design with a list of each possible pin, their location on the development and production hardware, and their desired initial state. I know because I've used those pin tables many times on the same project.

  <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
  <div class="subhead">2019-12-18</div>
  <p>
    Hello, World! This is an attempt to create some content to get a small simple website started. This is intended as an exercise for me to learn how to program a webpage. I am not a writer in any capacity, so bear with me as I learn how to write while I attempt it at the same time. Hopefully I'll have some interesting content to read someday. In the meantime here's a program, its definitely not intended just for me to figure out how preformatted text works...
  </p>

  <p>
    <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
  return 0;
}</pre>
