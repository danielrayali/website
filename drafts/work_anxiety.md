# Work Anxiety

I don't usually get anxiety in general, but sometimes I get work anxiety. Going out on a limb, I have a feeling that I am not alone. I know that sometimes anxiety is helpful, like when a deadline is due and you need to complete a task, but this just felt bad without any real reward. To address this, as I often need to do, I had to think about why I was feeling this way, then, maybe, I could figure out how

During a long commute home, I was able to figure out that this anxiety was about what I worked on. I felt like what I worked on was a direct reflection of my worth to the company. I worried that if I wasn't assigned to work on the newest, most interesting projects, I was viewed as not smart or capable.

Once I figured out why I felt this anxiety I could attempt to address the reasons making me feel this way. First, I had no historical basis to reach this conclusion. I had always been on projects that I felt were pretty cool. I was the software lead for our first satellite we launched as a company. I had helped implement cutting edge compression algorithms. I had ample opportunity to learn so many things.

Secondly, it would be a stretch to assign a full time software engineer to work on things with little to no value to the company. We had always operated on lean budgets and all wore many hats of development. The needs of individual projects, multiple projects, and the company are too dynamic to assign good developers on tasks that don't provide value.

Finally, I thought ultimately if I did find myself dreading going into work each day due to what I was working on I could ask for a change. I have a good manager and reasonable colleagues that would be more than willing to help me find the right fit in terms of tasking. What's more is ultimately if the fit isn't there, there are other jobs with better fits.
