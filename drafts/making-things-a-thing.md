# Making Things a Thing

As a software engineer, certain tasks require more time than expected. This is usually thought of as a Bad Thingâ„¢. Anxiety increases as expectation and reality diverge. Developers rush and quality suffers.

When this happens to me, I become tunnel visioned on completing the task. I lose sight of context. I under-think my planning and overdo my actions. My work/life balance suffers.

It is difficult for me to be aware of when this is happening, as it is happening. I convince myself efficiency is king and to drop non-essentials. Things like planning and documentation. This is made worse by the fact that my group thrives off of small budgets and rapid development. At one point "Rapid Solutions" was our division name.

In order to avoid this, I need something to remind myself to step back and check in. To insure

* all assumptions are still valid,
* the current end goal is still the same, and
* the current path is the most efficient.

I don't believe you need to feel stressed at work. If you do get this feeling of stress, this is when it is most important to stay on top of the things you are going to do and have done.

Once you can realize you are taking short cuts, step back, document your problems, solutions and decisions. This will serve as a reference for yourself, co-workers and new hires. Make it A Thing to yourself in others. Build consensus that a problem exists and there are ways to solve it. This will help you focus and be intentional.
