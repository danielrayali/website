# Making Things a Thing

As a software engineer, certain tasks require more time than expected. This is usually thought of as a Bad Thingâ„¢. Anxiety increases as expectation and reality diverge. Developers rush and quality suffers.

When this happens to me, I become tunnel visioned on completing the task. I loose sight of context. I under-think my planning and overdo my actions. My work/life balance suffers.

It is difficult for me to identify when this is happening, as it is happening. I convince myself efficiency is king and to eliminate non-essentials. Things like planning and documentation. This is made worse by the fact that my group thrives off of small budgets and rapid development. At one point our division was named "Rapid Solutions".

The opposite of this approach involves planning more and acting more efficently. Plan each task and allow yourself time to reflect on each action you take. This measured approach helps keep you on the most efficient path towards a completed solution. Do this with each fire you need to put out.

Take breaks. Mentally check in with the rest of the project. Ensure

* all assumptions are still valid,
* the current end goal is still the same, and
* the current path is the most efficient.

Document your problems, solutions and decisions. This will serve as a reference for yourself and co-workers.
