# Making Things a Thing

As a software engineer, certain tasks require more time than expected. This is usually thought of as a Bad Thing. As the delta between the expectation and the reality grows, so can feelings of anxiety. These can cause a developer to rush their work and ultimately lower the quality of their solution.

When this happens to me, my only focus becomes the assignment that has taken too long. I loose sight of the project as a whole. I tend to under-think my planning and overdo my actions. All in an effort to complete the task faster.

It is easy to know you need to slow down when you know you are going to fast. The hard part is recognizing it. A lot of times I think of it as just being extremely efficient and I am cutting out any part that is not necessary to the solution. This is made worse by the fact that my group thrives off of small budgets and rapid development. At one point our division was named "Rapid Solutions".

I think the opposite of this approach involves planning more and acting less frequently. Not necessarily acting less overall, but allowing yourself time to reflect on each action you take. This measured approach will help ensure you are on the most efficient path towards a completed solution. You are able to periodically check in with the rest of the project to ensure:

* all assumptions are still valid;
* the current end goal is still the same; and
* the current path is the most efficient.

I think it is important to keep in mind that work is never ending. Assuming nothing bad happens at your company, there will always be more tasking. It is important to recognize when you need to approach the task as something more than a ticket to close. Sometimes you'll need to address it as **A Thing**. For me, this means writing down the problem, thinking through possible approaches and considering the end goals. This is the essence of what I consider making something **A Thing**.
